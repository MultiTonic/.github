3. **Phase 3: Expansion and Incentive Rollout (Months 10-18)**  
   - **Expand User Base:** Increase the number of participating institutions.  
   - **Incentive Payments:** Distribute financial incentives to stakeholders.  
   - **Publish Intermediate Results:** Ensure regular publication of intermediate results.  
   
4. **Phase 4: Transition to Revenue Model (Months 19-24)**  
   - **Develop Licensing Model:** Create appropriate licensing options for institutions.  
   - **Market the System:** Promote the benefits of Multitonic to potential customers.  
   - **Establish Revenue Streams:** Begin generating revenue through licenses.  
   
### Expected Outcomes  
1. **Increased Data Availability:** A significant increase in the availability of intermediate results and failed experiment data.  
2. **Research Efficiency:** Reduction in duplication of research efforts and enhanced learning opportunities.  
3. **Sustainable Business:** A self-sustaining business model through licensing.  
   
### Evaluation and Metrics  
- **User Adoption:** Number of institutions deploying the Multitonic system.  
- **Data Published:** Volume of intermediate results published.  
- **User Satisfaction:** Feedback from participating institutions.  
- **Revenue Generation:** Success in transitioning to a revenue-generating model.  
   
### Enter the Multitonic Project  
The Multitonic Project aims to revolutionize the way intermediate experimental results are captured and shared within the research community. By addressing the critical issue of unpublished failed experiments, Multitonic will enhance research efficiency, foster collaboration, and eventually establish a sustainable business model.

### Multitonic Cloud Architecture Description

#### Overview

Multitonic is an advanced multi-system ecosystem deployed on the Azure Cloud. It leverages a self-managed Debian Linux stack and incorporates a suite of frameworks and services to automate data gathering and report generation across various business domains such as accounting, legal, payroll, and specific medical research tasks. The system is designed to be highly flexible and self-sufficient, integrating AI-driven analyses and various microservices to enhance operational efficiency.

#### Core Components

1. **Operating System and Stack**
   - **Debian Linux**: A robust and secure foundation for all applications and services.
   - **Apache**: Serves as the primary web server, handling HTTP requests and serving static and dynamic content.
   - **Git**: Version control system to manage code repositories and facilitate collaboration.

2. **Frameworks and Tools**
   - **LlamaIndex**: Utilized for indexing and querying data, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.
   - **AutoGen**: Supports the generation of AI models and automates various machine learning workflows.
   - **Code Execution Environments**: Isolated environments for running code, facilitating development, and testing.
   - **Postgres Database**: A reliable and scalable relational database system used for storing structured data.
